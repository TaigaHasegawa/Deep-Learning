# Deep Learning

This repo is what I've done in CS398 course at University Illinois at Urbana Champaign. 

Topics include convolution neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and deep reinforcement learning. Training of deep learning models using TensorFlow and PyTorch. A large amount of GPU resources are provided to the class.

Mathematical analysis of neural networks, reinforcement learning, and stochastic gradient descent algorithms will also be covered in lectures. 

Topics:

• Fully-connected and feedforward networks 

• Convolution networks

• Backpropagation

• Stochastic Gradient Descent

• Hyperparameter selection and parameter initialization

• Optimization algorithms (RMSprop, ADAM, momentum, etc.)

• Second-order optimization (e.g., Hessian-free optimization)

• TensorFlow, PyTorch, automatic differentiation, static versus dynamic graphs, define-by-run

• Regularization (L2 penalty, dropout, ensembles, data augmentation techniques)

• Batch normalization

• Residual neural networks

• Recurrent neural networks (LSTM and GRU networks)

• Video recognition (two-stream convolution network, 3D convolution networks, convolution
networks combined with LSTM, optical flow)

• Generative Adversarial Networks

• Deep reinforcement learning (Q-learning, actor-critic, policy gradient, experience replay,
double Q-learning, deep bootstrap networks, generalized advantage estimation, dueling
network, continuous control, Atari games, AlphaGo)

• Distributed training of deep learning models (e.g., asynchronous stochastic gradient descent)

• Theory of deep learning (universal approximation theorem, convergence rate, and recent
mathematical results)

• Convergence analysis of stochastic gradient descent, policy gradient, tabular Q-learning
